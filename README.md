Energy-based Generative Models use density representations of both real and generated data samples to compute their KL-divergence.
Given that the optimization only requires the gradients of the KL-divergence loss, the densities do not need to be normalized.
This gives the opportunity to use energy models that are not normalized (e.g. DDEs), but are very efficient in training and inference.
Table below summarizes the benefits of these models compared to other techniques:

The code example uses Tensorflow 2, numpy, and matplotlib (for visualizaiton)
